      braintree.dropin.create({
        authorization: 'CLIENT_AUTHORIZATION',
        selector: '#dropin-container'
      }, function (err, dropinInstance) {
        if (err) {
          // Handle any errors that might've occurred when creating Drop-in
          console.error(err);
          return;
        }
        submitButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
          dropinInstance.requestPaymentMethod(function (err, payload) {
            if (err) {
              // Handle errors in requesting payment method
            }

            // Send payload.nonce to your server
